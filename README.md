# Aarush Kukreja's Personal Portfolio Website

Built With:

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its SSR capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I like it because of its utility-first approach (I'm lazy).
- **Visual Studio Code**: Definitely didn't use Cursor.

Deployed With:
- **Vercel**: Vercel is my love. My sunshine.

## Development Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
